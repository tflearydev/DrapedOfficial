# DrapedOfficial

DrapedOfficial is an E-Commerce Platform that offers a selection of garments for sale, and is transitioning into being a platform for many brands to offer their clothing and products. I'm the head of dev for this project which called for a combination of my functionality and design skills to get done. 

The tasks included, but are not limited to, header/ product cards/ add to cart & checkout/ sales driven api integration/ account creation/ social media integration/ blog integration and more. 

The project's code is held in the company's private repo, but I am creating a readme and explaining my thought process to get it done, here.
